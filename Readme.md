# Device Price Classification using ML and deploy it using Django and Spring Boot APIs

Build and deploy a pretrained DEBERTA model for movie reviews semantic analysis with FastAPI and link it with a simple web page.

## Overview

Device price Classification involves using machine learning techniques to estimate the price range of mobile devices based on various features. These features can include specifications like battery power, RAM, camera quality, screen size, and more. By analyzing these features, we can predict whether a mobile device falls into a low-cost, medium-cost, high-cost, or very high-cost category.
